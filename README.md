## Project Details
ðŸ”¥ Agenda : In this project we are dividing spotify tracks into different clusters based on the Tempo and their Popularity.

ðŸ”¥ Method : 

ðŸŽ¯ First we see that data has no null values

ðŸŽ¯ Then we put values from 'Tempo' and 'Popularity' column into an array X.

ðŸŽ¯ We use K-means algorithm to divide these songs into clusters.

ðŸŽ¯ We plot an elbow curve to find optimal number of clusters for dividing the data point

ðŸŽ¯ Finally we plot a graph of Tempo vs. Popularity with data points divided into clusters where each cluster is represented by a colour

ðŸ”¥ Conclusion : We were able to divide the spotify tracks into 6 clusters based on Tempo and Popularity and plot them on a graph where each cluster is represented by different colour
